## Deploys

- Production browser extension: [chromewebstore.google.com]

- Production / Stable deploy: <https://wallet.oasis.io>

  The main deploy of the wallet available to the general public.

- Staging deploy: <https://wallet.stg.oasis.io>

  A deploy of the latest released version of the wallet available for users
  wanting to try out and test the latest version.

- Development deploy: <https://wallet.dev.oasis.io>

  A deploy of the latest code in the `master` branch available for power users
  and developers to try out the latest (unreleased) version.

## Features

### Wallet and Accounts

- Create/Restore wallets using standard [BIP-0039] mnemonic phrases
- Import accounts from your [Ledger] hardware wallet
- Import accounts directly from their private keys
- Address book of your saved contacts
- Create a profile to quickly access stored accounts with a password

### Transactions

- View transaction history
- Send ROSE tokens between Consensus accounts
- Stake/Debond ROSE tokens
- Deposit and withdraw from ParaTimes (Sapphire, Emerald, Cipher)
- Purchase ROSE using [Transak On-Ramp]

### Accessibility

- Available in multiple languages
- Should not crash when using Google Translate

## Getting started

### Installing and running from source code

You can quickly get started with the following commands:

```shell
yarn install
yarn start
```

Alternatively, to get started with a local network:

```shell
docker-compose up --build -d
yarn install
REACT_APP_LOCALNET=1 yarn start
```

Then go to <http://localhost:3000> to access the wallet.

### Test accounts

The local single-node network used for development comes built-in with two
accounts already having tokens.

```none

```

## Architecture

This code needs multiple components to run, all provided in the
[docker-compose.yml] for local development.

![Architecture diagram](docs/images/architecture.svg)

- [envoy-proxy], used as a gRPC gateway for live access to the oasis-node, to
  fetch live balance, information about the current state of the network, and to
  submit transactions.
- [oasis-nexus], is the official indexer for the Oasis Network, providing
the backend for the Oasis Explorer and ROSE Wallet.
It exposes an [API][oasis-nexus-api-spec].

- [oasis-scan], oasis blockchain explorer that enables view of historical data
  about transactions, accounts, validators, paratimes, blocks, proposals and
  more. It exposes an [API][scan-api-repo].

API that web wallet is using is determined during a build time.

## Contributing & development

### Running the tests

The repository has two different test strategies:

- E2E (End-to-end) tests, run with [Cypress], located in [cypress/](/cypress).
  These tests require the react app to be accessible on port `3000` and the
  docker-compose stack to be up.
- Unit & functional tests, run with [Jest], located throughout the codebase

To run all tests:

```bash
# Check typescript errors
yarn checkTs

# Run jest tests
yarn test

# Run playwright tests
yarn start
(cd playwright; yarn; npx playwright install --with-deps)
(cd playwright; yarn test)
# Or `yarn start:prod` and `yarn test:prod` to test production builds.
# Or `xvfb-run yarn test` to prevent browser windows opening.

# Run cypress tests
docker-compose up -d
# Run this in another terminal to keep it open
REACT_APP_LOCALNET=1 REACT_APP_BACKEND=oasismonitor yarn start
yarn cypress:run

# Manually check that content-security-policy in getSecurityHeaders.js doesn't
# break any functionality
yarn start:prod
# Open http://localhost:5000/account/oasis1qq3xrq0urs8qcffhvmhfhz4p0mu7ewc8rscnlwxe/stake
# and switch to testnet. This exercises at least: fonts, grpc, testnet grpc, API,
# and validator logos.

# Update screenshots
(cd playwright; yarn test:screenshots)
```

### Code style

This repository uses [prettier] as a code formatter and [eslint] as it's linter.
You can use the following commands:

```bash
# Lint the whole repository
yarn lint

# Fix linting issues
yarn lint:fix
```

#### Git Commit Messages

A quick summary:

- Separate subject from body with a blank line.
- Limit the subject line to 72 characters.
- Capitalize the subject line.
- Do not end the subject line with a period.
- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Use the imperative mood ("Move component to..." not "Moves component to...").
- Wrap the body at 80 characters.
- Use the body to explain _what_ and _why_ vs. _how_.

### Internationalization

Translating: We have [Transifex] to easily contribute translations.

Development: ROSE Wallet uses [react-i18next] for internationalization.
You can simply use the [useTranslation hook] inside your components to add
additional translation-ready strings. You can then export the new keys to the
[English translation.json] by running `yarn run extract-messages`.

Updating from [Transifex]: [English translation.json] is set as an automatically
updating resource in Transifex, so the new translation strings will appear in
Transifex a few hours after changes are merged. After they are translated:

1. click "Download file to translate" on the target languages,
2. `yarn run extract-messages`, and
3. create a new pull request titled _"i18n: Update translations from
   Transifex"_.

Adding a new language:

1. first add it to Transifex and translate the strings,
2. create a folder with the new language code in `src/locales`
   and download the translation file there,
3. add the new language to the [list of resources][i18n.ts]
